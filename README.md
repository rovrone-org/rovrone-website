# RovrOne Website

This repository contains the source code for the RovrOne Labs website, built with a unified Node.js/Express backend and a React/Vite frontend.

## Project Structure

The project is structured as a monorepo with a single root `package.json` managing all dependencies and scripts.

- **`/` (Root):** Contains the Express server (`server.js`), API routes (`routes/`), controllers (`controllers/`), and data (`data/`).
- **`/frontend`:** Contains the React source code.
- **`/frontend/dist`:** Contains the compiled, production-ready frontend assets. This directory is generated by the build process and served by the Express server.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v18 or later recommended)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/)

### Installation

Clone the repository and install the dependencies from the root directory:

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd rovrone-website
npm install
```

### Development

To run the application in development mode, you need to start the backend server and the frontend Vite dev server concurrently.

1.  **Start the Backend Server:**
    This will run the Express server using `nodemon`, which automatically restarts on file changes.

    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```
    The backend will be available at the same domain as the frontend, under the `/api` path.

2.  **Start the Frontend Dev Server:**
    In a separate terminal, run the Vite development server. This provides hot-reloading and a better development experience for the UI.

    ```bash
    npm run client:dev
    ```
    The frontend will be available at `http://localhost:5173`. The Vite server is configured to proxy API requests to the backend.

### Available Scripts

- `npm start`: Starts the production server (serves the built frontend and the API).
- `npm run dev`: Starts the backend server in development mode (using nodemon).
- `npm test`: Runs backend tests.
- `npm run client:dev`: Starts the frontend Vite dev server.
- `npm run client:build`: Builds the frontend for production.
- `npm run client:lint`: Lints the frontend code.
- `npm run client:preview`: Serves the built frontend locally for preview.
- `npm run client:test`: Runs frontend tests.

## Deployment

This application is configured for easy deployment on platforms like Vercel or Heroku.

### Vercel Deployment Guide

1.  Push your code to a Git repository (GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket).
2.  Import the project into Vercel.
3.  Configure the **Build and Output Settings** with the following overrides:
    - **Build Command:** `npm run client:build`
    - **Output Directory:** `frontend/dist`
4.  Click **Deploy**.

Vercel will automatically install dependencies, run the build command, and start the server.
